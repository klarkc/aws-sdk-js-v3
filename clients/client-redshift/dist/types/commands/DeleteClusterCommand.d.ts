/**
 * <p>Deletes a previously provisioned cluster without its final snapshot being created. A successful response from the web
 *             service indicates that the request was received correctly. Use <a>DescribeClusters</a> to monitor the status of the deletion. The delete
 *             operation cannot be canceled or reverted once submitted.
 * For more information about managing clusters, go to
 * <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html">Amazon Redshift Clusters</a>
 * in the <i>Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide</i>.</p>
 *         <p>If you want to shut down the cluster and retain it for future use, set
 *                 <i>SkipFinalClusterSnapshot</i> to <code>false</code> and specify a
 *             name for <i>FinalClusterSnapshotIdentifier</i>. You can later restore this
 *             snapshot to resume using the cluster. If a final cluster snapshot is requested, the
 *             status of the cluster will be "final-snapshot" while the snapshot is being taken, then
 *             it's "deleting" once Amazon Redshift begins deleting the cluster. </p>

 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { RedshiftClient, DeleteClusterCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-redshift"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { RedshiftClient, DeleteClusterCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-redshift"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new RedshiftClient(config);
 * const command = new DeleteClusterCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeleteClusterCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteClusterCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link RedshiftClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
