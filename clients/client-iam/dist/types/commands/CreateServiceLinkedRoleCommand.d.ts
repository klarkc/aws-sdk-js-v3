/**
 * <p>Creates an IAM role that is linked to a specific AWS service. The service controls
 *             the attached policies and when the role can be deleted. This helps ensure that the
 *             service is not broken by an unexpectedly changed or deleted role, which could put your
 *             AWS resources into an unknown state. Allowing the service to control the role helps
 *             improve service stability and proper cleanup when a service and its role are no longer
 *             needed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html">Using service-linked
 *                 roles</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p>
 *         <p>To attach a policy to this service-linked role, you must make the request using the
 *             AWS service that depends on this role.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { IAMClient, CreateServiceLinkedRoleCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-iam"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { IAMClient, CreateServiceLinkedRoleCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-iam"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new IAMClient(config);
 * const command = new CreateServiceLinkedRoleCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link CreateServiceLinkedRoleCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link CreateServiceLinkedRoleCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link IAMClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
