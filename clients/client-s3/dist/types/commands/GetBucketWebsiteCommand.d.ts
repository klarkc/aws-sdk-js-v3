/**
 * <p>Returns the website configuration for a bucket. To host website on Amazon S3, you can
 *          configure a bucket as website by adding a website configuration. For more information about
 *          hosting websites, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html">Hosting Websites on
 *             Amazon S3</a>. </p>
 *          <p>This GET action requires the <code>S3:GetBucketWebsite</code> permission. By default,
 *          only the bucket owner can read the bucket website configuration. However, bucket owners can
 *          allow other users to read the website configuration by writing a bucket policy granting
 *          them the <code>S3:GetBucketWebsite</code> permission.</p>
