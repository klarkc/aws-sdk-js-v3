/**
 * <p>To get the description of a registered consumer, provide the ARN of the consumer.
 *             Alternatively, you can provide the ARN of the data stream and the name you gave the
 *             consumer when you registered it. You may also provide all three parameters, as long as
 *             they don't conflict with each other. If you don't know the name or ARN of the consumer
 *             that you want to describe, you can use the <a>ListStreamConsumers</a>
 *             operation to get a list of the descriptions of all the consumers that are currently
 *             registered with a given data stream.</p>
 *         <p>This operation has a limit of 20 transactions per second per stream.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { KinesisClient, DescribeStreamConsumerCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-kinesis"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { KinesisClient, DescribeStreamConsumerCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-kinesis"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new KinesisClient(config);
 * const command = new DescribeStreamConsumerCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DescribeStreamConsumerCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DescribeStreamConsumerCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link KinesisClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
