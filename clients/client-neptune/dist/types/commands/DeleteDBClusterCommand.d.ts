/**
 * <p>The DeleteDBCluster action deletes a previously provisioned DB cluster. When you delete a
 *       DB cluster, all automated backups for that DB cluster are deleted and can't be recovered.
 *       Manual DB cluster snapshots of the specified DB cluster are not deleted.</p>
 *
 *          <p>Note that the DB Cluster cannot be deleted if deletion protection is enabled.  To
 *       delete it, you must first set its <code>DeletionProtection</code> field to
 *       <code>False</code>.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { NeptuneClient, DeleteDBClusterCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-neptune"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { NeptuneClient, DeleteDBClusterCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-neptune"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new NeptuneClient(config);
 * const command = new DeleteDBClusterCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeleteDBClusterCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteDBClusterCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link NeptuneClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
