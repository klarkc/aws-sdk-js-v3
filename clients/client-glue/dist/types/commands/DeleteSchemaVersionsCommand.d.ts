/**
 * <p>Remove versions from the specified schema. A version number or range may be supplied. If the compatibility mode forbids deleting of a version that is necessary, such as BACKWARDS_FULL, an error is returned.  Calling the <code>GetSchemaVersions</code> API after this call will list the status of the deleted versions.</p>
 *          <p>When the range of version numbers contain check pointed version, the API will return a 409 conflict and will not proceed with the deletion. You have to remove the checkpoint first using the <code>DeleteSchemaCheckpoint</code> API before using this API.</p>
 *          <p>You cannot use the <code>DeleteSchemaVersions</code> API to delete the first schema version in the schema set. The first schema version can only be deleted by the <code>DeleteSchema</code> API. This operation will also delete the attached <code>SchemaVersionMetadata</code> under the schema versions. Hard deletes will be enforced on the database.</p>
 *          <p>If the compatibility mode forbids deleting of a version that is necessary, such as BACKWARDS_FULL, an error is returned.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { GlueClient, DeleteSchemaVersionsCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-glue"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { GlueClient, DeleteSchemaVersionsCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-glue"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new GlueClient(config);
 * const command = new DeleteSchemaVersionsCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeleteSchemaVersionsCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteSchemaVersionsCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link GlueClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
