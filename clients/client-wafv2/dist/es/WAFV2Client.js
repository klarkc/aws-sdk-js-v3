/**
 * <note>
 *             <p>This is the latest version of the <b>AWS WAF</b> API, released in
 *             November, 2019. The names of the entities that you use to access this API, like
 *             endpoints and namespaces, all have the versioning information added, like "V2" or "v2",
 *             to distinguish from the prior version. We recommend migrating your resources to this
 *             version, because it has a number of significant improvements.</p>
 *             <p>If you used AWS WAF prior to this release, you can't use this AWS WAFV2 API to access
 *             any AWS WAF resources that you created before. You can access your old rules, web ACLs,
 *             and other AWS WAF resources only through the AWS WAF Classic APIs. The AWS WAF Classic
 *             APIs have retained the prior names, endpoints, and namespaces. </p>
 *             <p>For information, including how to migrate your AWS WAF resources to this version, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html">AWS WAF
 *                Developer Guide</a>. </p>
 *          </note>
 *          <p>AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests
 *          that are forwarded to Amazon CloudFront, an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an Application Load
 *          Balancer, or an AWS AppSync GraphQL API. AWS WAF also lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that
 *          you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query
 *           strings, the API Gateway REST API, CloudFront distribution, the Application Load Balancer,
 *           or the AWS AppSync GraphQL API responds to requests
 *          either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You also can
 *          configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked.</p>
 *          <p>This API guide is for developers who need detailed information about AWS WAF API
 *          actions, data types, and errors. For detailed information about AWS WAF features and an
 *          overview of how to use AWS WAF, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/">AWS WAF Developer Guide</a>.</p>
 *          <p>You can make calls using the endpoints listed in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#waf_region">AWS Service Endpoints for AWS WAF</a>. </p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>For regional applications, you can use any of the endpoints in the list.
 *                A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an API Gateway REST API, or an AppSync GraphQL API. </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>For AWS CloudFront applications, you must use the API endpoint listed for
 *                US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the
 *          programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">AWS SDKs</a>.</p>
 *          <p>We currently provide two versions of the AWS WAF API: this API and the prior versions,
 *          the classic AWS WAF APIs. This new API provides the same functionality as the older
 *          versions, with the following major improvements:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>You use one API for both global and regional applications. Where you need to
 *                distinguish the scope, you specify a <code>Scope</code> parameter and set it to
 *                   <code>CLOUDFRONT</code> or <code>REGIONAL</code>. </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>You can define a Web ACL or rule group with a single call, and update it with a
 *                single call. You define all rule specifications in JSON format, and pass them to your
 *                rule group or Web ACL calls.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>The limits AWS WAF places on the use of rules more closely reflects the cost of
 *                running each type of rule. Rule groups include capacity settings, so you know the
 *                maximum cost of a rule group when you use it.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
