/**
 * <p>Sets the maximum number of simultaneous executions for a function, and reserves capacity for that concurrency
 *       level.</p>
 *          <p>Concurrency settings apply to the function as a whole, including all published versions and the unpublished
 *       version. Reserving concurrency both ensures that your function has capacity to process the specified number of
 *       events simultaneously, and prevents it from scaling beyond that level. Use <a>GetFunction</a> to see
 *       the current setting for a function.</p>
 *          <p>Use <a>GetAccountSettings</a> to see your Regional concurrency limit. You can reserve concurrency
 *       for as many functions as you like, as long as you leave at least 100 simultaneous executions unreserved for
 *       functions that aren't configured with a per-function limit. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/concurrent-executions.html">Managing Concurrency</a>.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { LambdaClient, PutFunctionConcurrencyCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-lambda"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { LambdaClient, PutFunctionConcurrencyCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-lambda"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new LambdaClient(config);
 * const command = new PutFunctionConcurrencyCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link PutFunctionConcurrencyCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link PutFunctionConcurrencyCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link LambdaClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
